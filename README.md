# Test-projects
Development of a test website using Django Framework
      Access by creating a docker container via `docker-compose up --build` or by running `python manage.py runserver` in the testone directory
      The website is named Actors and can be accessed by `localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` 
      Sign in/Sign up & logout functionality
      Signed in users can post an article on the website containg information about actors, their description, email, slug and a thumbnail picture
      The main page shows the articles posted by the registered users
      This is a sample project made just for learning purposes and is no way intended to operate as a live website.
